Included a folder with implementations of max-heap and min-heap. In order to build the files, you need to run these commands from the home directory. 

'''code
cd ./BST

make clean

make HEAP

./bin/HEAP

To modify for your own testing purposes, be sure to check out the heap implementation classes in the .hpp files. 

To test the current implementation of the classes, you must go into the heap.cpp file and utilize the class for your own understanding.
