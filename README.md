# Welcome to the World of Brain-melting Algorithms!

Providing a list of all learned/implemented algorithms as well as analysis/runtime, so that you can learn how each algorithm works to ensure maximum educational benefit.  



# BST

Included a folder with implementations of max-heap and min-heap. In order to build the files, you need to run these commands from the home directory. 


```shell
cd ./BST

make clean

make HEAP

./bin/HEAP
```

To modify for your own testing purposes, be sure to check out the heap implementation classes in the .hpp files. 

To test the current implementation of the classes, you must go into the heap.cpp file and utilize the class for your own understanding. 



# Sorting

Included a folder containing all sorting algorithms. Current list of sorting algorithms implemented: 

- Merge Sort


To modify for your own testing purposes, the sorting.hpp file contains the functions for each algorithm. To use each sorting algorithm, be sure to go into the main.cpp and adapt for your own needs. 

To test the current implementation, simply run...

```shell
cd ./sorting

make clean

make main

./bin/MAIN
```
